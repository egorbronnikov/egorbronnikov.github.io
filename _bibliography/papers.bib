@article{Bronnikov2023WP,
  science={Political Science},
  abstract={This review essay aims to address several questions raised by 
            the impact of propaganda in modern autocracies. 
            It also examines the distinctions between this form of propaganda 
            and the one traditionally associated with classical dictatorships, 
            as well as its correlation with repression and protests in present-day autocracies. 
            To achieve this, the essay will conduct an in-depth analysis of recent 
            research papers and books that explore the fundamentals of 
            propaganda and its manifestations in contemporary autocratic regimes. 
            The objectives of this review are threefold. First, to provide 
            a synopsis of the cutting-edge knowledge on propaganda as presented in the literature. 
            Second, to offer a critical analysis that integrates recent 
            literature from political science and economics to yield a more comprehensive assessment. 
            Third, to identify the gaps in our current comprehension of propaganda in modern autocracies.},

@article{Bronnikov&Koch2023,
  science={Economics},
  abstract={Loneliness is a significant issue of our times: 
            every second individual feels lonely at least occasionally, 
            and every seventeenth person experiences it often or always. 
            The literature highlights the profound negative impact 
            of loneliness on both mental and physical health. 
            However, loneliness remains an area that is not thoroughly researched. 
            Specifically, there is a lack of studies on social 
            and economic preferences that establish the causal effect of loneliness. 
            To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first 
            to address this using economic laboratory settings. 
            We document the multidimensional effects of loneliness 
            on social and economic preferences. 
            The key implication of our study is that it elucidates why and 
            by which mechanisms lonely individuals are more 
            susceptible to exploitation compared to those who are not (or less) lonely, 
            putting them at a higher risk. 
            Furthermore, our paper offers insights for policymakers on how to mitigate this issue.},

@article{Bronnikov2022,
  science={Economics},
  abstract={Enhancing trust is recognized in the literature 
            as fostering a stronger legal system, accelerating economic 
            growth rates, and promoting higher levels of welfare. 
            Simultaneously, considerations of fairness play a 
            pivotal role in decision-making. However, there is a 
            lack of explicit research on how information about individuals' 
            fairness preferences impacts interpersonal trust—a question 
            that I am addressing in this study. The novel design of the laboratory 
            experiment presented in this paper sheds light on this matter. 
            Potentially, this paper contributes to the existing 
            literature on trust dimensionality and heterogeneity, 
            beliefs-dependence, and the social context. This study has two significant implications: 
            under a high level of interpersonal trust, (i) inequality is mitigated, 
            and (ii) fairness norms tend to converge towards strict egalitarianism. 
            In terms of policy implications, there is a need for greater diversity 
            or dimensionality of fairness to be introduced 
            (e.g., in taxation systems and social inclusivity).},

@article{Bronnikov2022JBEP,
  science={Economics},
  abstract={Humans making decisions, at large, are not strictly rational, 
            but sensitive to many external circumstances, or contexts.
            Examples of these include weather conditions, successes or
            failures of their favoured sports teams or even the time that
            has passed since lunch. Anyone who has been exposed to popular 
            results from Behavioural Economics will not be really
            surprised by these instances. However, such context 
            sensitivity also applies to university admission officers who have to
            judge candidates’ academic merits on cloudy or sunny days;
            to medical doctors who tend to be much more willing to prescribe 
            opioids to patients in their last working hours; or even
            to federal judges who are significantly more condescending to
            the accused person in nasty weather conditions outside. Are
            these cases problematic indeed? Many might guess that on
            average these errors may cancel out. However, the authors
            of Noise argue this conjecture is neither correct nor harmless
            from the social viewpoint.},

@article{Bronnikov2019JBEP,
  science={Economics},
  abstract={Laypeople – in their majority – do not realize the subtleties 
            of physics or biology, or come along with ready-made
            judgements about medicine or chemistry. This sequence could
            be continued and economics would not be an exception – yet
            it is. And way too many common judgments on economic
            issues turn out to be wrong. Examples abound: laypeople do
            not realize the impact of a drop in demand on market price
            changes, object to a tax rise even if it certainly leads to the
            overall improvement of future public welfare, fail to see the
            connection between real estate prices and interest rates, 
            neglect the adverse consequences of price regulation, get lost
            in unemployment-inflation trade-off (the Phillips curve), and
            neglect opportunity costs when making their own decisions.

            we bother about it? David Leiser and Yhonatan Shemesh
