@article{Bronnikov&Koch2023,
  abstract={Loneliness is a significant problem of our times: 
            each second individual feels lonely at least occasionally, 
            and each seventeenth experiences it often or always. 
            The dramatic negative effects of loneliness are known 
            from the literature to be both for mental and physical health. 
            However, loneliness is still an under-researched area. 
            Specifically, there is no study on the social and 
            economic preferences that establishes the causal effect of loneliness. 
            To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first 
            that deals with this using economic laboratory settings. 
            We document the multidimensional effect of loneliness on 
            social and economic preferences. The major implication of our 
            studies provides the reasons why and through which mechanism 
            lonely individuals can be much easier exploited than non (or less) 
            lonely ones and, hence, at higher risk. Our paper also provides 
            insights for policymakers on how to mitigate it.},

  abstract={Looking back at the history 
            of the twentieth century, 
            one of the most remarkable 
            images in the political domain 
            is dictatorships. Why does the 
            world observe much less of them now? 
            Was the exhibited almightiness by 
            a dictator just a delusion? Or have 
            they evolved in a different masked form?

@article{Bronnikov2022JBEP,
  abstract={Humans making decisions, at large, are not strictly rational, 
            but sensitive to many external circumstances, or contexts.
            Examples of these include weather conditions, successes or
            failures of their favoured sports teams or even the time that
            has passed since lunch. Anyone who has been exposed to popular 
            results from Behavioural Economics will not be really
            surprised by these instances. However, such context 
            sensitivity also applies to university admission officers who have to
            judge candidates’ academic merits on cloudy or sunny days;
            to medical doctors who tend to be much more willing to prescribe 
            opioids to patients in their last working hours; or even
            to federal judges who are significantly more condescending to
            the accused person in nasty weather conditions outside. Are
            these cases problematic indeed? Many might guess that on
            average these errors may cancel out. However, the authors
            of Noise argue this conjecture is neither correct nor harmless
            from the social viewpoint.},

@article{Bronnikov2019JBEP,
  abstract={Laypeople – in their majority – do not realize the subtleties 
            of physics or biology, or come along with ready-made
            judgements about medicine or chemistry. This sequence could
            be continued and economics would not be an exception – yet
            it is. And way too many common judgments on economic
            issues turn out to be wrong. Examples abound: laypeople do
            not realize the impact of a drop in demand on market price
            changes, object to a tax rise even if it certainly leads to the
            overall improvement of future public welfare, fail to see the
            connection between real estate prices and interest rates, 
            neglect the adverse consequences of price regulation, get lost
            in unemployment-inflation trade-off (the Phillips curve), and
            neglect opportunity costs when making their own decisions.
            Why is it so, and what is much more important – why should
            we bother about it? David Leiser and Yhonatan Shemesh
            provide an elegant and striking analysis of the behavioural
            origins of public misperceptions of the logic and development
            of modern economics, and of their implications for public policy.},
