I am a Doctoral Researcher and PhD Candidate in Economics at the School of Business and Economics at Maastricht University.

Additionally, I serve as a <i>pro bono publico</i> Adjunct Professor of economics at the School of Science at the Free University of Moscow (Brīvā Universitāte), a tuition-free online university committed to providing state-of-the-art courses by professors who were exiled from Russian state universities due to their political views (read more [here](/teaching/)). 

In the 2023-2024 academic year, I am also a <i>pbp</i> visiting (external) lecturer at the Department of Economics at the European University at St. Petersburg.

My research interests are Behavioural and Experimental Economics, (Behavioural) Game Theory, and Political Economy.

<i>Inter alia</i>, I am affiliated with the <i>HKS Misinformation Review</i> at the Harvard Kennedy School, the Institute for Replication, and Dissernet (read more [here](/affiliations/)).

I am affiliated with the Institute for Replication ([I4R](https://i4replication.org/)),  and Dissernet, a <i>pro bono publico</i> academic network that examines, documents and fights against plagiarism in Russian Doctoral and Habilitation theses. )
