<b>!!!!! CURRENTLY, THIS SITE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT !!!!! </b>


I am a Doctoral Researcher and PhD Candidate in Economics at the School of Business and Economics at Maastricht University (the Netherlands) and a Research Assistant at the Department of Economics at Harvard University (the USA).

My research interests are Behavioural and Experimental Economics, (Behavioural) Game Theory, and Political Economy.

Additionally, I serve as a pro bono publico Adjunct Professor of behavioural economics at the School of Science at the Free University of Moscow (Brīvā Universitāte), a tuition-free online University committed to providing state-of-the-art courses the majority of which are exiled from the contemporary State Russian Universities. You can read more about the Free University of Moscow [here](/teaching/).


<i>Inter alia</i>, I am a member of Dissernet, an academic network for science integrity that examines, documents and fights against plagiarism in Russian Doctoral and Habilitation theses (you can find more information either on the [Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissernet) or -- if you read in Russian -- on the [official website](https://www.dissernet.org/)).
