@article{BronnikovMIA2024,
  science={Political Sciences},
  abstract={Individuals with different identity-relevant beliefs often make divergent decisions even 
when presented with identical objective facts. 
This paper advances the theoretical understanding of motivated reasoning by 
developing a formal model that contrasts motivated information acquisition with 
a rational framework. We first explore how different types of decision makers---self- and unaware of their 
directional motives as well as information-sensitive motivated reasoners---make information acquisition 
choices based on their beliefs. Subsequently, we integrate the concept of separate decision utility to 
reevaluate our results in the context of actions. Our paper contributes to the theoretical 
literature on motivated reasoning and information acquisition, and connects to propaganda.},

@article{Bronnikov2023WP,
  science={Political Science},
  abstract={This review essay aims to address several questions raised by 
            the impact of propaganda in modern autocracies. 
            It also examines the distinctions between this form of propaganda 
            and the one traditionally associated with classical dictatorships, 
            as well as its correlation with repression and protests in present-day autocracies. 
            To achieve this, the essay will conduct an in-depth analysis of recent 
            research papers and books that explore the fundamentals of 
            propaganda and its manifestations in contemporary autocratic regimes. 
            The objectives of this review are threefold. First, to provide 
            a synopsis of the cutting-edge knowledge on propaganda as presented in the literature. 
            Second, to offer a critical analysis that integrates recent 
            literature from political science and economics to yield a more comprehensive assessment. 
            Third, to identify the gaps in our current comprehension of propaganda in modern autocracies.},

@article{Bronnikov2024,
  science={Economics},
  abstract={A remarkable state of the current 
            literature on motivated reasoning 
            is the idea that, although humans 
            update their beliefs in a manner that 
            deviates significantly from rational 
            Bayesian reasoning, this divergence does
            not necessarily translate into corresponding actions. 
            This paper is the first to explore how 
            distorted beliefs can influence individuals'
            effort provision in non-zero-sum games. 
            Through laboratory experiments, we aim to document 
            how subjects -- Bayesian updaters and Motivated reasoners -- 
            update their beliefs and make commitments 
            to exert effort in the context of identity-relevant tasks. },

@article{Bronnikov2022JBEP,
  science={Economics},
  abstract={Humans making decisions, at large, are not strictly rational, 
            but sensitive to many external circumstances, or contexts.
            Examples of these include weather conditions, successes or
            failures of their favoured sports teams or even the time that
            has passed since lunch. Anyone who has been exposed to popular 
            results from Behavioural Economics will not be really
            surprised by these instances. However, such context 
            sensitivity also applies to university admission officers who have to
            judge candidates’ academic merits on cloudy or sunny days;
            to medical doctors who tend to be much more willing to prescribe 
            opioids to patients in their last working hours; or even
            to federal judges who are significantly more condescending to
            the accused person in nasty weather conditions outside. Are
            these cases problematic indeed? Many might guess that on
            average these errors may cancel out. However, the authors
            of Noise argue this conjecture is neither correct nor harmless

  abstract={Laypeople – in their majority – do not realize the subtleties 
            of physics or biology, or come along with ready-made
            judgements about medicine or chemistry. This sequence could
            be continued and economics would not be an exception – yet
            it is. And way too many common judgments on economic
            issues turn out to be wrong. Examples abound: laypeople do
            not realize the impact of a drop in demand on market price
            changes, object to a tax rise even if it certainly leads to the
            overall improvement of future public welfare, fail to see the
            connection between real estate prices and interest rates, 
            neglect the adverse consequences of price regulation, get lost
            in unemployment-inflation trade-off (the Phillips curve), and
