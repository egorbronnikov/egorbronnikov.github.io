<b>!!!!! CURRENTLY, THIS SITE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT !!!!! </b>

I am a Doctoral Researcher and PhD Candidate in Economics at the School of Business and Economics at Maastricht University and a Research Assistant at the Department of Economics at Harvard University.

My research interests are Behavioural and Experimental Economics, (Behavioural) Game Theory, and Political Economy.

Additionally, I serve as a <i>pro bono publico</i> Adjunct Professor of behavioural economics at the School of Science at the Free University of Moscow (Brīvā Universitāte), a tuition-free online University committed to providing state-of-the-art courses by professors who are exiled from the state Russian Universities for their political views (read more [here](/teaching/)).

<i>Inter alia</i>, I am a member of Dissernet, a <i>pro bono publico</i> academic network that examines, documents and fights against plagiarism in Russian Doctoral and Habilitation theses (read more [here](/affiliations/)).

Previously, I worked at Utrecht University (Utrecht School of Economics), the University of Vienna (Vienna Centre for Experimental Economics), HSE University (International Laboratory for Experimental and Behavioural Economics; International College of Economics and Finance (ICEF); School of Psychology, Faculty of Social Sciences), and Transparency International Russia.
