_In April, the Free University of Moscow ceased operating after being labelled an “undesirable organisation” 
by the Russian government._ Egor Bronnikov _writes that the targeting of the university is one of the latest 
examples of Russia turning to intellectual isolation. He suggests that higher education institutions in Europe 
should redouble their efforts to engage with anti-war Russian students and academics._

HSE University, previously known as the Higher School of Economics, 
has been [consistently ranked](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2022/economics-econometrics?&countries=ru) 
[as the best university](https://www.shanghairanking.com/rankings/gras/2022/RS0501)
[in Economics and Social Science in Russia](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/search?region=europe&country=russia&subject=economics-business)
for many years. 
Despite this, the university 
has faced escalating political pressures that have resulted 
in numerous political dismissals of lecturers and professors.

In 2020, following a new wave of significant political firings from 
the university, a group of former professors decided to establish 
a new university to exist independently of political-administrative 
pressures from any governmental bodies. This newly-formed, 
primarily online university was named the [Free University](https://freemoscow.university/?lang=en).

Since its inception, the Free University has operated as a tuition-free 
institution committed to offering academic courses across a wide range of 
research fields. Given the current political climate, this initiative is 
of paramount importance as it allows students to remain engaged in 
global academia. Initially launching with just a few dozen courses 
during its first semester in 2020, the university had expanded its 
offerings substantially by autumn 2022, with more than seventy courses 
voluntarily taught by professors and provided free of charge to students.

However, in the spring of 2023, one year after the outbreak of the war 
in Ukraine, the university’s increasing popularity, coupled with ongoing 
political repression within Russia, led to the Ministry of Justice 
labelling it an “[undesirable organisation](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/moscows-free-university-branded-undesirable-kremlin-closes-doors).”
This label -- which has 
been given to Bard College, Transparency International and Bellingcat, 
among others -- entails two significant consequences: first, 
legal prohibition on operating in any form within Russia, and second, 
a high probability of criminal prosecution for all current professors 
at the university, many of whom are based in Russia.

One of the long-term threats for both Russia and the world is the growing 
tendency toward intellectual isolation, a trend actively promoted by Putin 
and his government. Currently, the Russian authorities are investing 
increasing efforts in infiltrating both school and university-level 
education with pro-Kremlin propaganda. While Putin’s regime, 
to the detriment of both Russia and the global community, is promoting 
intellectual isolation, resisting it would constitute an important step 
in countering the spread of Putinism.

One option for doing so would be for other universities to consider 
hosting already-existing courses that were previously administered by 
the Free University. There are currently around [6.2 million refugees](https://data.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine) 
who have fled the conflict in Ukraine, with [about 5.8 million of these in Europe](https://data.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine). 
There are also around a million people, including political refugees, 
who have emigrated from Russia. Research suggests [between a third and a 
half of refugees from Ukraine speak English proficiently](https://www.oecd.org/ukraine-hub/policy-responses/what-we-know-about-the-skills-and-early-labour-market-outcomes-of-refugees-from-ukraine-c7e694aa/), but only a 
small minority are proficient in other languages. This means several 
million of these people may struggle to resume their education abroad. 
Hosting Free University courses in local universities might offer one 
way to alleviate the burden on local education systems.

An alternative option would be for universities to jointly design 
courses and other initiatives with the Free University that meet 
the needs of both institutions. Millions of students in Russian 
universities are seeking high-quality education that is free from 
propaganda and the therapeutic value of spending even a few hours 
per week outside a toxic environment should not be underestimated.

Finally, universities might consider resuming and expanding academic 
collaboration with those Russian universities [that have not supported 
the war](https://www.eua.eu/news/842:eua-suspends-membership-of-12-russian-universities-following-statement-by-university-leaders.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=social-twitter-07-03-2022). These universities have faced significant pressure from 
Russian authorities and need support from the international 
academic community more than ever. This would be challenging 
to achieve, but there are some positive examples of adjustments 
being made, such[ as the recent exemption for Chevening Scholars 
from Russia](https://www.chevening.org/scholarship/russia/) from the previous requirement to return home for 
two years at the end of their award.

These actions could enrich the international academic community 
by diversifying the student and researcher population, creating 
opportunities for joint education and research, attracting talent 
and supporting those in need. But perhaps just as importantly, 
they would help reduce Russia’s intellectual isolation and thereby 
contribute to a consistent and strategic effort to confront global 
threats to democracy.
