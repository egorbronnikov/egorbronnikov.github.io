### Brief History of the FUM

HSE University (also known as the Higher School of Economics), was the best University in Economics in Russia according to many rankings (e.g., the QS subject ranking in Economics [in 2022](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2022/economics-econometrics?&countries=ru); the Shanghai Subject Ranking in Economics [in 2022](https://www.shanghairanking.com/rankings/gras/2022/RS0501); the US News subject ranking in Economics [in 2022](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/search?region=europe&country=russia&subject=economics-business)). However, it has been under severe political pressure for at least the last twelve years. Since that time, this has been resulting in a continuum of political dismissals of many professors and lecturers. 

In 2019, after a new huge wave of political layoffs from HSE University, a number of professors decide to establish a new University, free of tuition and independent of political-administrative pressure. This, so far online, University was given the name of [the Free University of Moscow](https://freemoscow.university/?lang=en) (FUM) also known as Brīvā Universitāte.

Since 2020, when it experienced the first semester, the FUM has grown _from several to almost seven dozen_ freely available courses many of which were exiled from the state-owned Russian Universities.

In the spring of 2023, the growing popularity of the Free University of Moscow has begun to be felt as a danger by the current Russian regime so salient that it was labelled as the so-called Undesirable (or Unwelcome) Organization on the territory of the Russian Federation. This euphemism of political repressions — by which, for example, among others, Bard College, Transparency International Russia, and Greenpeace were labelled — implies a high probability of criminal prosecution of all current professors at the FUM.

### Courses Taught at the FUM

Currently, I am teaching _(Ir)Rationality: Brief Introduction to Behavioural Economics_, a BSc-level course at the FUM.
In the meanwhile, I am preparing a new MRes-level course called _Behavioural Decision Theory_. Below you can find the syllabuses of both courses.
