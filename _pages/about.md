I am a Doctoral Researcher and PhD Candidate in Economics at the School of Business and Economics at Maastricht University.

My research interests are Behavioural and Experimental Economics, (Behavioural) Game Theory, and Political Economy.

Additionally, I serve as a <i>pro bono publico</i> Adjunct Professor of economics at the School of Science at the Free University of Moscow (Brīvā Universitāte), a tuition-free online university committed to providing state-of-the-art courses by professors who were exiled from Russian state universities due to their political views (read more [here](/teaching/)).

Being concerned about research replicability and academic integrity issues, I am, <i>inter alia</i>, affiliated with the Institute for Replication and Dissernet (read more [here](/affiliations/)).

I am affiliated with the Institute for Replication ([I4R](https://i4replication.org/)),  and Dissernet, a <i>pro bono publico</i> academic network that examines, documents and fights against plagiarism in Russian Doctoral and Habilitation theses. )
